/workspace/compute-aware-arch-search/distill_kl_trick.py:43: FutureWarning: `tokenizer` is deprecated and will be removed in version 5.0.0 for `DistillationTrainer.__init__`. Use `processing_class` instead.
  super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
The tokenizer has new PAD/BOS/EOS tokens that differ from the model config and generation config. The model config and generation config were aligned accordingly, being updated with the tokenizer's values. Updated tokens: {'bos_token_id': None, 'pad_token_id': 151643}.
